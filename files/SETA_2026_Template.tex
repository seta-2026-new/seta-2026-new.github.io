\section{Introduction}

We prove a conjecture due to John Smith~\cite{Smith1950} concerning sequences with unusual properties.

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:seq}
Sequences with unusual properties exist.
\end{theorem}

We shall prove Theorem~\ref{thm:seq} using a new method, which we call the magical method.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{The magical method}

In this section we describe our main method.


\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:technical}
If a sequence satisfies property A, then it satisfies property B.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Suppose for a contradiction that a sequences satifies property A, but does not property B. \dots
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:seq}}

In this section we complete the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:seq}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:seq}]
Argument \dots. This completes the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:seq}.
\end{proof}
