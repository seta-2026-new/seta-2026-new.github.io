									<b>Abstract</b>
									<br>
									Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) combines sensing and
									communication systems to utilize wireless resources efficiently,
									realize wide area environment sensing, and even to pursue mutual
									benefits. It is anticipated that ISAC would be one of the key enablers
									of 5G Advanced (5GA) and 6G wireless networks for supporting a variety
									of emerging applications. Obviously, transmitting signal design plays
									an essential role in ISAC systems. This talk shall provide recent
									advances in ISAC signal designs, including coordinated signal design,
									communications signal-based design, radar signal-based design, and
									dedicated dual-function signal design. In particular, a new concept
									called low ambiguity zone (LAZ) and some theoretical bounds, as well as
									related LAZ signal designs, shall be presented.

									Sustainable and Multifunctional Wireless Networks
									<br>
									<b>Abstract</b>
									<br>
									The future global cellular infrastructure will underpin a variety of
									applications, such as smart city solutions, urban security,
									infrastructure monitoring, and smart mobility, among others. These
									emerging applications require new network functionalities that go
									beyond traditional communication. Key network KPIs for 6G include Gb/s
									data rates, cm-level localization, μs-level latency, and Tb/Joule
									energy efficiency. Additionally, future networks must support the UN's
									Sustainable Development Goals to ensure sustainability, net-zero
									emissions, resilience, and inclusivity.
									The multifunctionality and net-zero emissions agenda call for a
									redesign of multi-access technologies for 6G and beyond. In this talk,
									I focus on enabling multifunctionality in signals and wireless
									transmissions as a means of reducing hardware redundancy and minimizing
									carbon footprint. We will explore the emerging field of integrated
									sensing and communications (ISAC), which represents a paradigm shift
									towards combining sensing and communication functionalities within a
									single transmission, utilizing a single spectrum and ultimately sharing
									a common infrastructure.

									<br>
									<b>Abstract</b>
									<p style="text-align:justify!important; margin-bottom: 0;">
										Massive machine-type communications (mMTC) is an important use case of
										5G and beyond wireless technology for concretizing the Internet of
										Things (IoT). In mMTC, grant-free access is a key enabler for
										connecting wireless devices with low latency and low signaling
										overhead. In uplink grant-free access, user-specific, non-orthogonal
										sequences are uniquely assigned to devices for non-orthogonal multiple
										access (NOMA), where each active device attempts to access a base
										station (BS) using its own sequence. Then, a BS receiver has to
										identify active devices, estimate channel profiles, and detect
										transmitted data, through the superimposed sequences from active
										devices. Exploiting the sparse activity, the principle of compressed
										sensing (CS) has been widely used to perform joint activity detection,
										channel estimation, and data detection for uplink grant-free access in
										mMTC.
										<br>
										In this talk, some applications of pseudorandom sequences for uplink
										grant-free access in mMTC are introduced. First of all, Golay
										complementary sequences are used for spreading sequences in uplink
										grant-free NOMA. From the properties of Golay complementary sequences,
										the spreading sequences provide low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)
										for multicarrier transmission. Also, a theoretical connection to
										Reed-Muller codes shows that the spreading sequences guarantee
										theoretically bounded low coherence for the spreading matrix. Second,
										a design framework is presented for non-orthogonal signature
										sequences, where the design principle relies on unimodular masking
										sequences represented by characters over finite fields. The Weil
										bounds on character sums are leveraged to show that the signature
										sequence matrix has theoretically bounded low coherence. Simulation
										results demonstrate that the spreading and the signature sequences
										achieve excellent performance of joint activity detection, channel
										estimation, and data detection for uplink grant-free access in mMTC.
										Thanks to the algebraic structure, the non-orthogonal sequences enjoy
										the benefits of small phases and small storage space in practical
										implementations. Finally, potential applications of pseudorandom
										sequences for mMTC will be discussed as a future research topic.

									Bus coding for low-power on-chip interconnects
									<br>
									<b>Abstract</b>
									<br>
									Due to the recent drastic demand on AI accelerator hardware, novel
									very-large-scale (and even wafer-scale) circuit integration
									architectures, which may involve 3D stacking mutliple chiplets onto
									silicon interposers with sophisticated layer interconnections, have
									been introduced. The capacitive crosstalk of the on-chip bus
									interconnects induces high power consumption and limits data
									transmission speed. The classical solution of adding ground shielding
									is area-inefficient. One of the more area-efficient approaches, called
									bus coding, is to add one or a few redundant wires which send encoded
									signals in such a way that the overall latency and/or power consumption
									is reduced. The most famous single-redundancy-wire bus code is the bus
									invert code, which has been standardized and adopted in numerous
									inter-chip bus interconnects applications. In this talk, various known
									families of low-power bus codes will be surveyed. It will be pointed
									out that many known bus codes may actually increase, rather than
									decrease, overall power consumption, after the codec power consumption
									is taken into consideration. Lastly, our latest works on low-power bus
									codes, which can achieve the state-of-the-art overall power saving,
									will be presented.
